# Assignment-02 Tasks
1. Compute Sobel derivatives in X and Y directions and visualize gradient magnitude
2. Apply Sobel on noisy images and analyze its performance. Use Gaussian filtering before Sobel for noise reduction. Compare the result.
3. Compute 2D Fourier Transform (FFT) of an image and display magnitude of the frequency spectrum.
4. Apply the Standard Hough Transform to detect straight lines. Adjust thresholds and parameters for better results.
5. Apply Canny edge detection algorithm. Adjust thresholds and parameters for better results. Use Trackbar if you can.
